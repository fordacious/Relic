Important stuff here :)

==What is this?==
Relic is a game that I (Lachlan Ford, fordyfor@gmail.com) have been trying to finish for the past few years, but due to continuous commitments and distractions, I have been unable to make significant progress on it. This repo is my latest attempt.

==Why open source?==
I chose to make it open source because the game I want to make is bigger than what I can do alone. Opening the game enables others to callaborate on the game and allows people to learn from its design/development. This visibility is also a good motivation to finish it. 

==Contributing==
I'll mostly be driving this project myself, but feel free to fork the repo and open pull requests. Also feel free to send suggestions/problems with the game to me :) I'll get some kind of a discussion system going, I'll get some kind of release system going, so people can download and play builds as it is developed.
If the game does get finished and monetized, I'll set up a system which will bring the profits back to everyone who helped out :)
Contribution includes but is not limited to, design, code, art, sound, testing, marketing and distribution

==License n tings==
I will own the IP of Relic and materials related to it, unless otherwise stated.
I do not know how the game will be monetised if at all. That is yet to be determined.
Will need to figure out how to reimburse contributions in a fair manner.
