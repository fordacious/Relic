TODO

1. Write a design doc.

- What's your game about? 2-sentence elevator pitch, major themes, inspiration (movies, books, games).

- Don't go overboard but at least tell others what you're planning to do. This also helps tremendously with
keeping yourself motivated (think of the people viewing this as your shareholders and you'll be pushing to 
hit milestones).

- Bring in tons of concept art/music. THAT really keeps people focused on a end result, even if you're nowhere near
the level needed to make your game look/sound like it.

- Milestones, milestones, milestones. Make them. Even if you fail, you (and the viewers) learn to make better
milestones for the next project.

Good luck!
